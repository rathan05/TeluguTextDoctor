NLP-driven Spelling Correction for Telugu Language

# Spelling Correction for Telugu Language

This project aims to provide a spelling correction solution for the Telugu language. It utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to suggest corrections for misspelled Telugu words.

## Overview

The project consists of several components:

1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**: Telugu text data is collected and preprocessed to create a corpus for spelling correction.

2. **Indexing**: N-gram indexing is performed on the preprocessed data to efficiently retrieve suggestions for misspelled words.

3. **Spelling Correction Algorithm**: A spelling correction algorithm is implemented, which suggests corrections based on the similarity coefficient between the misspelled word and words in the corpus.

4. **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: The project includes a CLI for users to input Telugu words for spelling correction.

## Usage

To use the spelling correction functionality:

1. Run the program.
2. Enter a Telugu word to check its spelling.
3. If the word is misspelled, the program suggests corrections based on the closest matches found in the corpus.
4. Optionally, the user can provide feedback on the suggested corrections to refine the results further.

## Contribution

Contributions to the project are welcome and can be made in the following areas:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Indexing techniques
- Spelling correction algorithm improvement
- Evaluation methods

## Future Modifications

Potential modifications and enhancements for the project include:

- Collecting data from diverse sources to improve the corpus
- Implementing variable indexing for N-grams to optimize retrieval
- Enhancing the spelling correction algorithm with advanced similarity metrics
- Conducting evaluations with different sizes of N in N-gram indexing for performance analysis
